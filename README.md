# HR-Analytics: Employee Attrition & Performance
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition within an organization to understand why employees leave and how organizations can mitigate attrition rates. Employee retention is a crucial factor as high attrition negatively impacts productivity, financial stability, and overall performance.
## Key Business Questions
The analysis is designed to answer the following questions:
* What factors contribute most to employee attrition?

* What measures can the company take to retain employees?

* What business value does predictive modeling bring?

* Can predictive models help save costs related to employee turnover?

* Which business units are most affected by attrition?

## Data Analysis Approach

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA is performed to find patterns and insights in the data. Various techniques used include:

* Continuous Variables: Histograms and boxplots to analyze central tendency and spread.

* Categorical Variables: Bar charts and count plots to understand distributions.

* Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps to identify relationships between different attributes.

## Predictive Modeling

Machine learning models are employed to predict employee attrition based on various factors such as age, salary, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. Model performance is evaluated using:

* Accuracy

* Precision

* Recall

* F1-score
## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python (3.x)

* Jupyter Notebook

* Required libraries:

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
